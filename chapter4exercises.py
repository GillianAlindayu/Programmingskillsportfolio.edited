#Chapter 4: Exercises

# Exercise 1: Alien colors #1 ballot_box_with_check: 

    #Imagine an alien just shut down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color that assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'
    #Write if an statement whether the alien's color is green, if it is, print a message that the player just earned five points. 
    #Write one version of this program that passes that if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output )

#passing version 
#alien_colors_1.py

#Exercise 2: alien colors #2 ballot_box_with_check:

#Choose a color for an alien you did in exercise 5-3 and write an if-else chain. 
    # If the alien color is green, the statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting an alien 
    # If the alien color isn't green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points. 
    # Write a version of this program that runs if the block and another that runs the else block.

# Exercise 3: Alien colors #3 ballot_box_with_check:

#Turn your if-else chain from exercise 5-4 into an if-elifelse chain.
    # If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
    # If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
    # If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
    # Write three versions of this program, making sure each messages is printed for the appropriate  
    # alien color.

# Exercise 4: Stages of life: ballot_box_wth_check: 

# Write an if-elif-else chain that determine a person's stage of life 

    #If a person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby 
    #If the person is at least 2 years old, less than 4, print the message that the person is a toddler.
    #If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print the message that the person is a child.
    #If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print the message that the person is a teenager.
    #If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print the message that the person is an adult.
    #If the person is at least 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.

# Exercise 5: Favorite fruit ballot_box_with_check: 

# Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series in independent if statements that checks certain fruits on your list. 

    # Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
    # Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. if the fruit is on your list, the

 #Python program: favorite fruit:
