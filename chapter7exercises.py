# Chapter 7 Functions: exercises.

# Exercise 1: message: ballot_box_with_check

# Write a function called display_message that prints one sentence telling everyone that you are learning about in this chapter.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly. 

# Python program of message

# Exercise 2: Favorite book: ballot_box_with_check: 

# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter, title.
# The function should ptint a message, such as one of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland. Call the function, making sure to include a book title as an argument in the function call.
# But instead of Alice and wonderland, It is the user's favorite book which is the Harry potter series. 
# python program of favorite book

# Exercise 4: T-shirt ballot_box_with_check: 

# Write a function called make_chirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.
# The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.
# Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the function a second time using keyword arguments.

# Exercise 4: cities: ballot_box_with_check: 

# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts and its country.
# The function should print a simple sentence, such as  Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.

# Python program names of the city
